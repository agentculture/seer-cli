## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Vendored the `remember` + `recall` memory skills from eidetic-cli**
  (cite-don't-import) — the write/read halves of eidetic's shared
  `~/.eidetic/memory` surface, so this agent (Claude and its colleague backend)
  can persist facts across sessions and recall them later, sharing one store.
  `remember` drives `eidetic remember` (idempotent upsert of one JSON record or
  an NDJSON batch on stdin, dedup by id + content hash); `recall` drives
  `eidetic recall` with four search modes — exact / approximate / keyword /
  hybrid — each hit carrying text, full provenance metadata, a relevance score,
  and a freshness signal. The `.sh` wrappers are byte-verbatim from eidetic-cli
  (their first-party origin); each `SKILL.md` is localized only in the
  illustrative `--scope <nick>` examples (Provenance keeps "First-party to
  eidetic-cli"). Both default to this agent's PRIVATE scope, reading the suffix
  from `culture.yaml`. Runtime dep: the `eidetic` CLI on PATH (else a local
  eidetic-cli checkout with `uv`). Propagated by rollout-cli's `eidetic-memory`
  recipe.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-25

Skills update from `guildmaster` ([antoine#28](https://github.com/agentculture/antoine/issues/28)):
the AgentCulture skills-supplier role migrated from `steward` to `guildmaster`,
and the vendored kit was resynced and expanded. Cite, don't import.

### Added

- **6 new vendored skills** under `.claude/skills/` (cite, don't import):
  - `agent-config` — read-only one-agent config inventory; backs `guild show`.
  - `doc-test-alignment` — STUB skill (contract only); verifies docs still
    match code + tests.
  - `pypi-maintainer` — switch a package install between production PyPI,
    TestPyPI, and a local editable checkout.
  - `think` / `spec-to-plan` / `assign-to-workforce` — the devague
    idea→spec→plan→implement workflow trio. **Inbound:** origin
    `agentculture/devague`, only re-broadcast by guildmaster. Runtime dep:
    `uv tool install devague`.

### Changed

- **Supplier cutover `steward` → `guildmaster`.** `docs/skill-sources.md`
  (intro, policy, all canonical rows), `CLAUDE.md` (Vendored Skills section),
  and `.claude/skills.local.yaml.example` now name `guildmaster` as the
  skills supplier; re-sync targets `../guildmaster/.claude/skills/<name>/`.
- **Resynced the 5 already-vendored skills** to guildmaster's current copies:
  `cicd`, `communicate`, `run-tests`, `sonarclaude`, `version-bump`.
  `communicate` gains the supplier briefing templates
  (`templates/skill-new-brief.md`).
- **`type: command` normalized across every `SKILL.md`** (the 11 vendored
  skills + the antoine-origin `eval`). antoine declares a culture agent
  (`culture.yaml`), and culture/agex's skill loader silently skips a
  type-less `SKILL.md`; load-bearing on the culture backend, harmless on
  claude-code. Recorded as a per-row divergence in `docs/skill-sources.md`.
- `.claude/skills.local.yaml.example` — fixed the stale `seer-cli` name
  (now `antoine`) left over from the rename.

### Fixed

- **`agent-config/scripts/show.sh` description parser** (Qodo, PR #29) — the
  awk extractor now also stops at the frontmatter terminator (`^---$`), not
  just the next YAML key. Without it, a `description:` that is the last
  frontmatter key bled into the markdown body — which the `type: command`
  normalization above triggers by placing `type:` before `description:`.
  Marked `# antoine divergence:`; to be filed upstream on guildmaster.
- **`agent-config/SKILL.md` provenance** (Qodo, PR #29) — reworded `Vendored
  from steward` → `Vendored from guildmaster (originated in steward)` so the
  cited source matches antoine's actual supplier.

### Preserved

- antoine's `cicd/scripts/portability-lint.sh` divergence (drops the GNU-only
  `xargs -r` flag at two sites, marked `# antoine divergence:`) was re-applied
  after the verbatim resync, plus its `SKILL.md` description note.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-17

### Removed

- `antoine.lookup` engine + `kata classify` / `kata grep` / `kata recent`
  verbs — migrated to `code-lens-cli` v0.10.0.
- `antoine.repo` engine + `python -m antoine.repo {profile,connections,graph}`
  surface — migrated to `code-lens-cli` v0.10.0.
- `.claude/skills/code-lookup/` and `.claude/skills/repo-map/` — re-homed
  under `agentculture/code-lens-cli/.claude/skills/`.
- 16 tests for the migrated surface (`test_ast_scope`, `test_classify*`,
  `test_grep*`, `test_recent*`, `test_repo_*`).

### Changed

- `docs/skill-sources.md`: `code-lookup` and `repo-map` rows now point
  at `code-lens-cli` as the upstream supplier; added "graduation"
  precedent bullet to the vendoring policy.
- `CLAUDE.md` "Dispatching subagents" table now names `code-lens`
  verbs (soft dep — install with `uv tool install code-lens-cli`);
  preserved as **evidence** of the first catalog this loop produced
  rather than as a prescription antoine pushes downstream.
- `README.md`: new "Results of this loop" section pointing at
  `code-lens-cli`; corrected the alt-publish bullet to drop
  `code-lens-cli` (which left the dual-publish loop in 0.10.0).

### Migration

- `kata classify .` → `code-lens classify .`
- `kata grep <pattern> .` → `code-lens grep <pattern> .`
- `kata recent .` → `code-lens recent .`
- `python -m antoine.repo profile .` → `code-lens profile .`

antoine continues to ship the capture/reduce/assess loop
(`kata log {tail, gc, grep}` plus the forthcoming cells 2–8); the
inspection verbs were extracted because they are the loop's *result*,
not its mechanism. See <https://github.com/agentculture/code-lens-cli/issues/2>
for handover history.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- `kata log {tail, gc, grep}` verbs for inspecting the local capture log
  under `.antoine/log/`.
- `antoine.kata.log` engine subpackage: `LogEntry` schema, daily-sharded
  `LogStore`, `ArgsSidecar`, TTL `gc` with privacy invariant (args files
  deleted first).
- `.gitignore` rule: everything under `.antoine/` is local-only except
  `katas.toml` (the future committed ledger; introduced in cell 4).
- `docs/kata/log-schema.md` documenting the JSONL row format.

This is **Cell 1** of the kata-cli capture/reduce/assess loop. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-kata-loop-design.md` for the full
8-cell scope.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- CLAUDE.md + README.md: add Name section explaining antoine = N to 1 (collapse N ad-hoc tool calls into one `kata` / `antoine` verb; `kata-cli` is the PyPI distribution label, not a command name).
- README.md: expand "What's here" to cover the three things antoine manages — the CLI surface (dual-published as `antoine-cli` / `kata-cli` / `code-lens-cli`), the `experiments/scripts_eval/` A/B harness, and the recorded results in `docs/eval-rounds/`.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- PyPI distribution renamed from `antoine` to `antoine-cli` to avoid name collision and stay consistent with the `kata-cli` / `code-lens-cli` alt-publish naming convention. The Python module (`antoine`) and console script (`antoine`) are unchanged; only the wheel-distribution name moves. `_resolve_version()` fallback list and `.github/workflows/publish.yml` publish loop updated to match.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- **Repository rename: `seer-cli` → `antoine`.** GitHub remote moved to `agentculture/antoine`; primary PyPI distribution renamed from `seer-cli` to `antoine`; `kata-cli` and `code-lens-cli` alt-publishes preserved. Python module renamed `seer/` → `antoine/`; primary console script renamed `seer` → `antoine` (the `kata` alias is retained). All imports, error classes (`SeerError` → `AntoineError`, `_SeerArgumentParser` → `_AntoineArgumentParser`), env vars (`SEER_EVAL_*` → `ANTOINE_EVAL_*`), Sonar project key (`agentculture_seer-cli` → `agentculture_antoine`), `culture.yaml` agent suffix, vendored skill bodies, and the scripts-eval harness's banned-pattern detection updated accordingly. Historical `CHANGELOG.md` entries, `docs/eval-rounds/`, and dated `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/` files are intentionally left referring to `seer` — those describe past state.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- scripts-eval: arm-B (directed-use) — rider explicitly instructs the subagent to use repo-map + code-lookup scripts. Cells captured under `results/<run>/arm-B/`. `corpus.yaml` arms field becomes `[A, B, C]`.
- scripts-eval: `judge.py` is now pair-aware. `judge prepare` / `judge record` take `--pair AC|AB|BC`; new label flag `--blind-label-for-b`. Verdicts land under `cell["judges"][pair]`; the AC pair still mirrors to legacy `cell["judge"]` for back-compat. New `iter_jobs_pair` / `record_verdict_pair` public APIs; old `iter_jobs` / `record_verdict` stay as AC-pair wrappers.
- scripts-eval: summarize.py renders both A-vs-B and A-vs-C winner tallies in the run-state table, with per-pair verdict tables in the evidence section.
- eval skill: arm-A rider tightened to also forbid the code-lookup skill / seer.lookup / seer grep/recent/classify so "without" means without both new skills. Added arm-B procedure section and pair-aware judge procedure (--pair AB | AC).

### Changed

- eval skill: switch-arm.sh no longer moves .claude/skills/repo-map/ on disk; arm-A relies on the verbal rider alone (rider proved sufficient; move-aside dance made operator setup brittle).
- scripts-eval: report.py violation patterns now also flag code-lookup script use; report aggregates median validation across all three arms; per-cell view shows every captured arm.
- scripts-eval: validate.py / backfill.py iterate over _io.ARMS instead of hardcoding (A, C).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-16

### Changed

- Restored the dual-publish loop in the `test-publish` job after PyPI-side pending-publisher configs were fixed for `kata-cli` and `code-lens-cli` on both TestPyPI and prod PyPI. Future PRs now exercise all three trusted-publisher paths on TestPyPI before merge.

### Fixed

- Retry of v0.7.0 prod publish: `seer-cli==0.7.0` uploaded successfully on the v0.7.0 merge, but `kata-cli` and `code-lens-cli` failed with PyPI `400 Non-user identities cannot create new projects` because the pending-publisher configs pointed at incorrect repository names. v0.7.1 retries with corrected configs.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- `kata` console-script aliasing `seer = seer.cli:main` (same behavior, new command name introduced ahead of the issue #17 product rename)
- Dual-publish to PyPI under three names: `seer-cli`, `kata-cli`, `code-lens-cli` — all containing identical wheel content. Lean slice of issue #17.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- `seer grep <pattern> [path]` — ripgrep matches paired with enclosing Python function/class via stdlib AST scope resolver. Requires `rg` on PATH.
- `seer recent [path] [-n N]` — `git log -n N` paired with per-commit AST symbol diff (added/removed/modified functions and classes per changed Python file).
- `seer.lookup.ast_scope` — private stdlib-`ast` scope resolver (`Scope`, `list_symbols`, `find_enclosing`) consumed by `grep` and `recent`.
- `repo-map profile` Tier-1 fields: `build_test` (test cmd + coverage gate + python_requires), `ci_workflows` (file + workflow name), `publish_target` (PyPI/GHCR + trigger summary), `git_remote` (host/owner/repo from `origin`), `module_summaries` (first docstring line per top-level module).
- `repo-map profile` Tier-2 online fields (default on): `github_state` (latest release, open issues, default branch, CI status on default) via `gh`; `pypi_state` (latest version + released_at) via pypi.org JSON API. Soft-skip on missing `gh` / network errors.
- `repo-map profile --basic` flag opts out of Tier-2 online enrichment.
- `code-lookup/scripts/grep.sh` and `code-lookup/scripts/recent.sh` wrapper scripts.

### Changed

- `profile_shallow` signature now accepts a keyword-only `basic: bool = False` argument.
- `.claude/skills/repo-map/SKILL.md` description enumerates the seven new Tier-1/Tier-2 fields and the `--basic` flag.
- `.claude/skills/code-lookup/SKILL.md` description enumerates all three verbs (`classify`, `grep`, `recent`) with concrete return shapes.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- seer classify verb: deterministic project-type tags with per-tag evidence, in one tool call. Tags: python / node / bash / cli / library / dockerized / tested / packaged-pypi / agentculture-sibling. Markdown by default; --json for structured. Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-16-seer-classify-design.md
- code-lookup skill: companion to repo-map, houses the classify wrapper + SKILL.md (frontmatter enumerates output fields + token-math + when-NOT-to-use, per the PR #13 / Qodo lesson)

### Fixed

- `seer.lookup.classify._build_context` now wraps `pyproject.toml` reads in a try/except for `OSError` and `UnicodeDecodeError`, mapping them to a structured `SeerError(EXIT_ENV_ERROR)` via the new `_pyproject_unreadable_error` factory. `package.json` reads now also handle `OSError` + `UnicodeDecodeError` (alongside the existing `JSONDecodeError`) as soft-skip, consistent with the "fail-soft for optional sources" pattern. `_rule_packaged_pypi` extends its workflow-file read guard from `OSError` only to `(OSError, UnicodeDecodeError)`. Without these guards, a non-UTF8 manifest or workflow file would escape the structured-error policy and surface as a generic "unexpected" exception.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- repo-map profile: surface a depth-2 package tree under Package layout (top-level packages, subpackages, module files) so the section actually answers "top-level components" without re-grepping
- repo-map profile: insert --- horizontal rules between top-level sections so dense table sections (vendored skills, changelog) have a clear visual anchor
- repo-map SKILL.md description: enumerate the concrete fields each verb returns (profile / connections / graph) and add explicit token-math + "when NOT to use" guidance, so callers can do the cost/benefit math at skill-selection time

### Fixed

- repo-map profile: vendored-skills table no longer mangles Source cells containing inline backtick spans (e.g. `agentculture/steward` (`.claude/skills/cicd/`)) — only fully balanced `…` wrappers are unwrapped, internal spans stay intact

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- **scripts-eval: replaced hook-driven cell capture with operator-driven
  `trial.py`.** The new `experiments/scripts_eval/trial.py` exposes two
  subcommands — `start` (stamps in-flight metadata + `start_time`,
  reads `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, prints a `trial_id`) and `end` (reads
  the subagent's sidechain transcript at
  `$HOME/.claude/projects/<encoded_cwd>/<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`,
  parses the real CC schema, and writes the cell JSON). Operator
  workflow per trial becomes `trial start → dispatch Agent → trial end`.
  The previous `SubagentStop` hook + `capture.py` chain parsed a stale
  CC schema (`ts` epoch float, top-level `content`) against the wrong
  file (operator transcript, not subagent sidechain), producing cells
  with empty `answer_text`. Tests now use a sanitized real sidechain as
  the fixture, refusing to mock a schema that might diverge from reality.
- `.claude/skills/eval/SKILL.md` updated to invoke `trial start` /
  `trial end` per dispatch instead of `capture` after dispatch.
- `docs/eval-rounds/2026-05-15-round-01.md` preflight points at
  `switch-arm.sh` for env + skill-state setup.
- Deleted `experiments/scripts_eval/capture.py` (replaced by `trial.py`)
  and `experiments/scripts_eval/hooks/subagent_stop.py` (replaced by
  `trial end`); their tests
  (`tests/scripts_eval/test_capture.py`,
  `tests/scripts_eval/test_hooks_subagent_stop.py`) went with them. The
  fake-schema fixtures
  `tests/scripts_eval/fixtures/{transcript_min,transcript_with_late_msg}.jsonl`
  — which made the broken hook's tests pass — are also gone. The
  `SubagentStop` hook entry was dropped from `.claude/settings.json`.

### Added

- `experiments/scripts_eval/switch-arm.sh` — sourceable helper that
  flips between arm A and arm C: exports `SEER_EVAL_RUN_ID` /
  `SEER_EVAL_ARM` and moves `.claude/skills/repo-map` aside (arm A) or
  restores it (arm C). Idempotent on re-source; refuses direct
  execution; guards against half-broken disk state.
- `experiments/scripts_eval/backfill.py` — one-shot script that
  re-extracts cells captured by the previous (broken) hook from their
  sidechain transcripts. Used to recover the 6 round-01
  `agtag/q-profile-overview` cells. Matches each cell to its sidechain
  via the CC-emitted `<agent>.meta.json` description (e.g.
  `Arm-A t1: agtag profile`) plus a corpus-aware (target, question)
  identification from the sidechain's first user prompt; skips judge
  dispatches whose description starts with `scripts_eval judge:`.
- `tests/scripts_eval/fixtures/sidechain_min.jsonl` — sanitized real
  CC subagent sidechain transcript, the canonical fixture for extraction
  tests.

### Fixed

- Round 01 `agtag/q-profile-overview` cells (both arms, all 3 trials)
  had empty `answer_text` from the previous capture chain. Backfilled
  via the new extraction logic; judges re-run against the now-populated
  text. Final verdicts: A=1, C=2, tie=0 (all slight margins). Notable
  finding: arm-C produced competitive answers without invoking
  `repo-map` — appropriate behavior for an overview question on a small
  repo, per the established evaluation framing (skill should be reached
  for when needed, not unconditionally).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` realigned to `agentculture/steward` as the
  source of truth: the `test` job now runs only pytest + the SonarCloud
  scan, with lint extracted into a sibling `lint` job
  (black/isort/flake8/bandit/markdownlint-cli2). `SONAR_TOKEN` is promoted
  directly to job env so the step's `if:` gates on it inline — matches
  steward's wiring exactly.
- `sonar-project.properties`: dropped `sonar.qualitygate.wait=true` /
  `sonar.qualitygate.timeout=600` (the only real divergence from steward —
  CI no longer blocks on the quality-gate decision; SonarCloud's PR comment
  still surfaces the outcome). Also dropped `sonar.projectName` and
  `sonar.sourceEncoding` for byte-level parity with
  `steward/sonar-project.properties`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- scripts-eval: `eval` skill (`.claude/skills/eval/SKILL.md`) — locks the operator procedure for running one set of the harness (one `(target, question)` row × 3 trials × one arm) as a reusable, round-agnostic skill. Reads `$SEER_EVAL_RUN_ID` and writes to `docs/eval-rounds/$SEER_EVAL_RUN_ID.md`, so it serves round 01 today and future rounds without modification. Bundles the preflight checks (env vars, `repo-map` skill state, manifest init), arm-A/arm-C procedures, the judge-subagent dispatch contract (`description: scripts_eval judge: <pair_key>`), and the post-set summarize + commit. Listed in `docs/skill-sources.md` as a seer-cli-original skill (like `repo-map`).

### Changed

- docs/eval-rounds/2026-05-15-round-01.md trimmed to round-specific bits only (run metadata, preflight, paste templates, evidence accumulator). The procedure now lives in the `eval` skill — single source of truth, picked up automatically when an operator session triggers the skill.
- scripts-eval: `eval` skill replaces the `python3 -c "import json; …"` prompt-extraction step with `jq -j '.prompt_text'` — no Python required, and `-j` joins without a trailing newline so the dispatched bytes match what `prepare` emitted. Aligns with the project's `uv run`-managed Python and avoids ad-hoc stdlib invocations in operator runbooks.

### Fixed

- scripts-eval: `summarize._replace_between` switched from a `re.DOTALL` regex pattern to index-based slicing on the original text. A judge's reasoning that verbatim quoted a section-end marker (e.g., `<!-- evidence:end -->`) could previously terminate the regex at the inner occurrence on a subsequent summarize call, corrupting the file and breaking idempotence. The render step now also disarms any literal marker strings in the payload by rewriting `<!--` to `<\!--` inside the matched marker text — markdown renders identically, and `str.find` no longer matches the escaped form as a marker on later passes.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- scripts-eval: `summarize.py` — accumulator that walks `results/<run_id>/arm-A/` and `arm-C/`, groups paired cells by `(repo_id, question_id)`, and rewrites two marker-bracketed regions of a tracked evidence markdown file: a per-set progress table (`<!-- runstate:... -->`) and per-set verdict tables with judge reasoning (`<!-- evidence:... -->`). Idempotent on replay so the operator runs it at the end of every session without thinking about state.
- docs/eval-rounds/2026-05-15-round-01.md — single tracked file that serves as both the runbook (preflight + per-arm procedure + paste templates) and the evidence accumulator (auto-updated by `summarize.py`). Raw per-cell JSONs stay gitignored under `results/2026-05-15-round-01/`; this file is the committed evidence for round 01.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- scripts-eval: judge.py now runs the pairwise blind LLM-as-judge through an operator-dispatched `general-purpose` subagent instead of calling the Anthropic API directly. CLI gains `prepare` (emit subagent jobs, one per paired cell, in a stable seeded-blinding order) and `record` (parse the subagent's verdict text, validate the vocabulary, de-blind A/C, and write the locked-surface `judge` block to both paired cell JSONs; idempotent on replay). All LLM cognition in the harness now happens inside subagents.
- scripts-eval: `pre_tool` hook skips Agent dispatches whose `tool_input.description` starts with `scripts_eval judge:` so judge dispatches don't drop orphan `.jsonl` files into `raw/` (capture.py picks the oldest-mtime *.jsonl and would otherwise consume a judge file as the wrong tester cell). The description prefix is a load-bearing contract documented in RUNBOOK.md.
- scripts-eval: RUNBOOK judging section rewritten for the per-pair prepare → dispatch → record operator loop. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is no longer a prerequisite in the operator's shell — the subagent's API call is harness-managed.

### Fixed

- scripts-eval: judge no longer sees each answer's `### tools_used` / `### evidence` tail. Those tails de-blind the pairwise comparison — arm C's tail can name `scripts/profile.sh` or `seer.repo`, immediately revealing the equipped arm to the judge. The strip is applied in `prepare`'s view only; `answer_text` on disk is unchanged so `validate.py` recall scores stay stable.
- scripts-eval: `_extract_json` now scans for balanced `{...}` spans (respecting nested braces and quoted strings) and returns the *first* valid JSON object, matching the RUNBOOK contract. The previous greedy `r"\{.*\}"` regex captured from the first `{` to the *last* `}`, so a chatty subagent emitting multiple JSON blobs (false start + correction) would either fail to parse or persist the wrong object.
- scripts-eval: `record_verdict` now validates blind-label complementarity before any disk I/O — both labels must be in `{answer_X, answer_Y}` and distinct. The previous code allowed identical labels through `_de_blind`, which would silently return `A` and persist the wrong winner to the locked-surface `judge.comparison`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- `[tool.coverage.run]`: added `parallel=true`, `concurrency=["thread","multiprocessing"]`, `sigterm=true` so pytest-xdist (`-n auto`) worker shards merge into a single `coverage.xml`. Mirrors `agentculture/culture`. Local verification: 86.03% coverage on 130 tests (was effectively unmergeable across xdist workers before).
- `sonar-project.properties`: added `sonar.projectName=seer-cli`, `sonar.qualitygate.wait=true`, `sonar.qualitygate.timeout=600`. The wait/timeout pair lets `tests.yml` block on SonarCloud's quality-gate decision rather than racing past it, bounded so an unavailable SonarCloud does not hang the runner.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- scripts-eval harness for A/B-testing the repo-map skill (experiments/scripts_eval/) — env-var-gated hooks, three-layer scoring (mechanical/code-validation/LLM-judge), 5-repo round-1 corpus, RUNBOOK + README + judge_rubric.
- experiments dep group with anthropic and jsonschema (use uv sync --group experiments to install).

### Changed

- .claude/settings.json registers the three eval hooks; they no-op outside an active SEER_EVAL_RUN_ID session.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- `repo-map` Claude Code skill plus the underlying `seer.repo` Python
  module. Three verbs — `profile`, `connections`, `graph` — emit
  deterministic markdown (default) or JSON (`--json`) about one repo,
  its connected neighbors, or an entire workspace.
- Generic repo detection: any directory with `pyproject.toml`,
  `.claude/skills/`, or a user-configured marker file qualifies.
  Optional `.claude/skills/repo-map/config.json` for per-workspace
  defaults (roots, additional markers, skip dirs).
- `SeerError` extended with `reason` and `kind` fields; `emit_error`
  text mode now prints a `reason:` line between `error:` and `hint:`
  when present. `EXIT_INTERNAL = 3` reserved for bug-wrapped exceptions.

### Changed

- `pyyaml>=6.0` added as the first runtime dependency (used for
  `culture.yaml` parsing and any other YAML marker the user configures).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- AgentCulture sibling scaffold: the `seer` package (hatchling,
  Python >=3.12, zero runtime deps) with the shared CLI chassis —
  structured errors, a strict stdout/stderr split, and `--json` support.
- Placeholder agent-first verbs `learn` / `explain` / `whoami` — honest
  "not yet implemented; seer is greenfield" stubs.
- CI workflows: `tests.yml` (pytest + coverage + flake8 + bandit +
  SonarCloud + version-check), `security-checks.yml` (bandit + pylint),
  `publish.yml` (TestPyPI on PR, PyPI on main, via OIDC Trusted Publishing).
- `culture.yaml` declaring the `seer` agent nick.
- Vendored skills from steward: `cicd`, `communicate`, `run-tests`,
  `sonarclaude`, `version-bump`. Provenance tracked in
  `docs/skill-sources.md`.
- Repo-local lint configs: `.flake8`, `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`,
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; `sonar-project.properties`; the
  `.claude/skills.local.yaml.example` per-machine config template.

Resolves #1.
